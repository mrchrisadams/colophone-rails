# Colophone Rails
========================

This is the Rails app that powers colophone.

Right now, there's some server side stuff to support the design and wireframe work we did today.

### Stuff we need to add

* an index page
* views to expose the correct form elements
* controllers to direct these requests accordingly
* models for users, questions and answers
* styled pages!
* AN ACTUAL WORKING APP
